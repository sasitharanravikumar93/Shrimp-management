    'Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)': 'The ratio of feed given to the weight gain of fish/shrimp. Lower FCR indicates more efficient feeding.',
    'Dissolved Oxygen (DO)': 'The amount of oxygen dissolved in water, crucial for aquatic life. Optimal levels for shrimp are 5-7 mg/L.',
    'pH Level': 'A measure of water acidity or alkalinity. For shrimp farming, optimal pH is between 6.5-8.5.',
    'Salinity': 'The salt concentration in water, measured in parts per thousand (ppt). Shrimp require 15-35 ppt for optimal growth.',
    'Biomass': 'The total weight of organisms in a given area or volume. Used to calculate feeding requirements.',
    'Feed Efficiency': 'How effectively feed is converted into growth. Higher efficiency means less waste and lower costs.',
    'Growth Rate': 'The speed at which shrimp increase in size, typically measured in grams per day.',
    'Water Temperature': 'The temperature of the water, which affects metabolic rates and growth. Optimal for shrimp is 28-32Â°C.',
    'Ammonia': 'A toxic compound that can build up in aquaculture systems. Levels should be kept below 0.02 mg/L.',
    'Nitrite': 'A toxic compound produced during the nitrogen cycle. Levels should be kept below 0.2 mg/L.',
    'Alkalinity': 'The water\'s ability to neutralize acids, important for pH stability. Optimal range is 80-150 mg/L.',
    'Turbidity': 'The clarity of water, affected by suspended particles. High turbidity can reduce oxygen levels.',
    'Harvest Size': 'The target weight at which shrimp are ready for market, typically 25-30 grams for most species.'
