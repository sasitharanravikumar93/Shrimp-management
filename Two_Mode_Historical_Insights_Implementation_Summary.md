# Two-Mode Historical Insights Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the two-mode historical insights feature that allows users to compare ponds in two different ways:
1. Current Season Comparison: Compare ponds within the current active season with a specific date range
2. Historical Comparison: Compare ponds across different seasons without date range restrictions

## Backend Implementation

### Updated Controller: `server/controllers/historicalInsightsController.js`

#### New Functions Added:
1. **`getAvailableSeasons`** - Retrieves all seasons for historical comparison
2. **`getPondsBySeason`** - Gets ponds for a specific season
3. **`getPondsForCurrentSeason`** - Gets ponds for the current active season
4. **`comparePondsWithDateRange`** - Compares ponds in current season mode with date range
5. **`comparePondsHistorical`** - Compares ponds in historical mode without date range

#### Key Changes:
- Removed dependency on `date-fns` library
- Separated comparison logic into two distinct functions for each mode
- Added proper validation for each mode
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Updated Routes: `server/routes/historicalInsights.js`

#### New Endpoints:
1. `GET /api/historical-insights/seasons` - Get all seasons
2. `GET /api/historical-insights/ponds/current` - Get ponds for current season
3. `GET /api/historical-insights/ponds/season/:seasonId` - Get ponds for specific season
4. `POST /api/historical-insights/compare/current` - Compare ponds with date range
5. `POST /api/historical-insights/compare/historical` - Compare ponds without date range
6. `POST /api/historical-insights/export` - Export comparison data

## Frontend Implementation

### Updated API Service: `client/src/services/api.js`

#### New Functions:
1. `getHistoricalSeasons` - Fetches all seasons
2. `getHistoricalPondsForCurrentSeason` - Fetches ponds for current season
3. `getHistoricalPondsBySeasonId` - Fetches ponds for specific season
4. `comparePondsCurrentSeason` - Compares ponds with date range
5. `comparePondsHistorical` - Compares ponds without date range
6. `exportComparisonData` - Exports comparison data

### Updated Hooks: `client/src/hooks/useHistoricalInsights.js`

#### New Hooks:
1. `useHistoricalSeasons` - Fetches seasons for historical mode
2. `useHistoricalPondsForCurrentSeason` - Fetches ponds for current season mode
3. `useHistoricalPondsBySeason` - Fetches ponds for specific season in historical mode
4. `usePondComparisonCurrentSeason` - Compares ponds in current season mode
5. `usePondComparisonHistorical` - Compares ponds in historical mode
6. `useExportComparison` - Exports comparison data

### Completely Rewritten Page: `client/src/pages/HistoricalInsightsPage.js`

#### Key Features:
1. **Mode Selection**:
   - Radio buttons to switch between "Current Season" and "Historical" modes
   - Conditional rendering based on selected mode

2. **Current Season Mode UI**:
   - Date range pickers (start/end dates)
   - Dual pond selection from current season ponds
   - Compare button with validation

3. **Historical Mode UI**:
   - Season selection for both ponds (can be same or different seasons)
   - Pond selection for each season
   - Compare button with validation

4. **Common Features**:
   - Metrics selection with checkboxes
   - Tabbed interface for viewing different metrics
   - Composed charts showing both pond data and differences
   - Export functionality
   - Summary statistics for each metric

## Implementation Details

### Current Season Mode
- Fetches ponds from the currently active season
- Requires date range selection
- Validates date range against season dates
- Compares pond data within the specified date range

### Historical Mode
- Allows selection of any two seasons
- No date range restriction
- Compares entire crop cycles of selected ponds
- Seasons can be the same or different

### Data Visualization
- Interactive charts with pond data lines and difference area
- Tabbed interface for switching between metrics
- Summary statistics showing data points and average differences
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Validation
- Ensures different ponds are selected in both modes
- Validates date ranges in current season mode
- Prevents comparison with missing data
- Real-time validation feedback

## API Endpoints

### Current Season Mode Flow:
1. `GET /api/historical-insights/ponds/current` - Get ponds for current season
2. `POST /api/historical-insights/compare/current` - Compare ponds with date range
3. `POST /api/historical-insights/export` - Export data

### Historical Mode Flow:
1. `GET /api/historical-insights/seasons` - Get all seasons
2. `GET /api/historical-insights/ponds/season/:seasonId` - Get ponds for selected seasons
3. `POST /api/historical-insights/compare/historical` - Compare ponds without date range
4. `POST /api/historical-insights/export` - Export data

## Available Metrics for Comparison
1. Water Temperature
2. pH Level
3. Dissolved Oxygen
4. Ammonia Level
5. Feed Consumption
6. Average Shrimp Weight

## Future Enhancements
1. Add more sophisticated data alignment algorithms
2. Implement additional export formats (Excel, PDF)
3. Add statistical analysis features (correlation, trend analysis)
4. Implement saving and loading of comparison configurations
5. Add benchmarking against ideal values or historical averages
