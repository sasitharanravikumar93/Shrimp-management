# Dashboard

## Purpose
The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your shrimp farm's operational data. It allows you to monitor key metrics related to feed, growth, and water quality, offering both a high-level "Whole Farm Overview" and detailed "Individual Pond View" insights. It also includes AI-driven insights and projected growth trajectories.

## Navigation
Upon logging in, you will be automatically directed to the Dashboard. You can also access it at any time by clicking on "Dashboard" in the sidebar navigation.

## Key Features
*   **Whole Farm Overview:** Aggregated data and charts for the entire farm, providing a summary of overall performance.
*   **Individual Pond View:** Detailed data and charts for a specific pond, allowing for in-depth analysis of its performance.
*   **Projected Growth Trajectory:** Growth charts include projections to help anticipate future growth and plan accordingly.
*   **Global Season Selector:** Filter all data displayed on the dashboard by selecting a specific season from the global season selector in the sidebar.

## How to Use

### 1. Switching Between Farm Overview and Individual Pond View
