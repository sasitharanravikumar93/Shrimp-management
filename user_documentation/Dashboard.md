# Dashboard

## Purpose
The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your shrimp farm's operational data. It allows you to monitor key metrics related to feed, growth, and water quality, offering both a high-level "Whole Farm Overview" and detailed "Individual Pond View" insights. It also includes AI-driven insights and projected growth trajectories.

## Navigation
Upon logging in, you will be automatically directed to the Dashboard. You can also access it at any time by clicking on "Dashboard" in the sidebar navigation.

## Key Features
*   **Whole Farm Overview:** Aggregated data and charts for the entire farm, providing a summary of overall performance.
*   **Individual Pond View:** Detailed data and charts for a specific pond, allowing for in-depth analysis of its performance.
*   **AI Insights:** Proactive data visualization and insights generated by the system to help you make informed decisions.
*   **Projected Growth Trajectory:** Growth charts include projections to help anticipate future growth and plan accordingly.
*   **Customizable Widgets:** The dashboard is widget-based, allowing you to toggle the visibility of different data displays to customize your view.
*   **Global Season Selector:** Filter all data displayed on the dashboard by selecting a specific season from the global season selector in the sidebar.

## How to Use

### 1. Switching Between Farm Overview and Individual Pond View
*   On the Dashboard, you will see a toggle or selection mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or buttons) to switch between "Whole Farm Overview" and "Individual Pond View".
*   If you select "Individual Pond View", you will then be prompted to choose a specific pond from a list.

### 2. Understanding the Data
*   **Charts:** Hover over chart elements (e.g., bars, lines) to see detailed tooltips with specific data points.
*   **Tables:** Review the data tables for precise numerical values.
*   **AI Insights:** Pay attention to the "AI Insights" widget for system-generated observations and recommendations.

### 3. Customizing Your Dashboard
*   Look for a "Customize Dashboard" or "Widget Settings" option (usually an icon like a gear or three dots).
*   Clicking this will open a panel where you can select which widgets you want to see on your dashboard. Toggle them on or off as per your preference.

### 4. Filtering by Season
*   Use the "Season" dropdown in the sidebar (or a prominent location on the dashboard) to select the season for which you want to view data. All displayed data will update to reflect the selected season.

## Tips and Notes
*   Regularly check the "AI Insights" for automated analysis of your farm's performance.
*   Use the "Individual Pond View" to deep-dive into specific pond issues or successes.
*   Ensure the correct season is selected to view relevant data.
