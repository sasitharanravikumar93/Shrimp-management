# Pond Timeline

## Purpose
The Pond Timeline functionality provides a chronological view of significant events and data points related to a specific pond throughout its operational cycle. This helps in understanding the history and performance of individual ponds. This feature is integrated into the Pond Management page.

## Navigation
This feature is accessed from the Pond Management page by switching to the Calendar View.

## Key Features
*   **Chronological Event Display:** Shows events such as stocking, harvesting, significant water quality changes, and major feed adjustments in a calendar format.
*   **Event Filtering:** Filter events by type to focus on specific categories.
*   **Search Functionality:** Search for specific events by keyword.
*   **Pond-Specific Focus:** Provides a dedicated view for a single pond.

## How to Use
1.  Navigate to the pond you want to view the timeline for via the Admin Page or Dashboard.
2.  Switch to "Calendar View" using the toggle button in the top right.
3.  Use the search bar to find specific events.
4.  Filter events by type using the filter buttons (Feeding, Water Quality, Growth Sampling, Routine, Maintenance, Monitoring).
5.  Click on events in the calendar to view details.

## Tips and Notes
*   Use the Pond Timeline to review the entire history of a pond's cycle, which can be invaluable for post-harvest analysis and future planning.
*   Correlate events (e.g., a disease outbreak) with changes in water quality or growth data to identify causal relationships.
*   Add new events using the "Add New Event" button in Calendar View.
