# Pond Timeline

## Purpose
The Pond Timeline provides a chronological view of significant events and data points related to a specific pond throughout its operational cycle. This helps in understanding the history and performance of individual ponds.

## Navigation
This feature is typically accessed from the Dashboard when viewing an 'Individual Pond View' or from a dedicated 'Pond Management' section where you can select a pond and then view its timeline.

## Key Features
*   **Chronological Event Display:** Shows events such as stocking, harvesting, significant water quality changes, and major feed adjustments in a timeline format.
*   **Integrated Data Points:** Displays key data points (e.g., average weight, FCR) at relevant times on the timeline.
*   **Pond-Specific Focus:** Provides a dedicated view for a single pond.

## How to Use
1.  Navigate to the Dashboard and select the 'Individual Pond View'.
2.  Choose the specific pond for which you want to view the timeline.
3.  Look for a 'Timeline' or 'History' tab/section within the pond's detailed view.
4.  The timeline will display events and data points in chronological order.
*   You may be able to click on individual events or data points for more details.

## Tips and Notes
*   Use the Pond Timeline to review the entire history of a pond's cycle, which can be invaluable for post-harvest analysis and future planning.
*   Correlate events (e.g., a disease outbreak) with changes in water quality or growth data to identify causal relationships.
