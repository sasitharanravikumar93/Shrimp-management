## Review and Testing Instructions

To review and test the implemented functionality:

1. **Backend Testing**:
   - Run the existing nursery batch tests to ensure no regressions
   - Test the new API endpoints with tools like Postman
   - Verify that events can be created for nursery batches
   - Check that all new event types work correctly

2. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Navigate to the nursery management page
   - Create a new nursery batch with all fields
   - View the detail page for a nursery batch
   - Test the calendar view
   - Try creating different types of events
   - Verify navigation between pages

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete workflow from creating a nursery batch to adding events
   - Verify that data is correctly stored and retrieved
   - Check that the calendar displays events properly

The core functionality for nursery management similar to pond management has been implemented, but the advanced features like media support and comprehensive data visualization still need to be completed.
