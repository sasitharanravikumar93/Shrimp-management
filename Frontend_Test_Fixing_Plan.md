### **Frontend Test Fixing Plan (Revised)**

#### **1. Overview of Failures (Updated)**

Based on the latest `results.json` file, the frontend test suite still has failures, though the numbers have shifted:

*   **Total Tests:** 40 (previously 50)
*   **Passed:** 26 (previously 27)
*   **Failed:** 14 (previously 23)
*   **Suites with Failures:** 9 (previously 8)
*   **Suites with Runtime Errors:** 5 (previously 4)

While the number of individual failed tests has decreased, the increase in failed test suites and runtime errors indicates persistent underlying issues in the test setup or component rendering.

#### **2. Root Cause Analysis (Updated)**

The primary root cause remains issues with asynchronous operations and state management within the `useApi` hooks, and how these are tested. The previous assumption of global `axios` mocking was not directly applicable to `useApi.test.js` as it uses passed-in mock functions.

#### **3. Detailed Fixing Plan (Revised)**

The strategy will focus on ensuring the `useApi` hooks correctly handle asynchronous states (loading, data, error) and that their tests accurately reflect these transitions.

##### **3.1. Fix `useApi.test.js` (Revisited)**

The `useApi.test.js` suite is critical as it tests the core data fetching and mutation hooks.

*   **`useApiData should handle API errors`**:
    *   **Problem:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'message')`. This means `result.current.error` is `null` instead of an `Error` object. The `useApiData` hook was not correctly setting the error state as an `Error` object.
    *   **Fix:** Changed `setError(err.message);` to `setError(err);` in `useApiData` to store the actual `Error` object. This makes the test assertion `expect(result.current.error.message).toBe(errorMessage);` work correctly.

*   **`useApiMutation should execute mutation successfully` & `useApiMutation should handle mutation errors`**:
    *   **Problem:** `Error: Timed out in waitForNextUpdate after 1000ms.`. This indicated that the `act` block or the asynchronous operations within `useApiMutation` were not completing within the timeout, or the `loading` state was not transitioning as expected.
    *   **Fix:**
        1.  Changed `setError(err.message);` to `setError(err);` in `useApiMutation` to store the actual `Error` object.
        2.  Modified the `finally` block in `attemptMutation` within `useApiMutation` to always set `setLoading(false);` when the mutation finishes, regardless of `remainingRetries`.

##### **3.2. Component Tests (General Approach - Continued)**

For other component tests, the general approach of mocking API calls and ensuring proper rendering remains valid.

*   **`DashboardPage.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `await waitFor` with `await screen.findByText` for initial data loading. Simplified assertions for static components. Replaced `element.click()` with `userEvent.click()` for interactions.
*   **`FeedViewPage.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Updated `DatePicker` mock to be consistent with simpler `TextField` rendering. Replaced `fireEvent` with `userEvent` for all interactions (search, pond selection, export, apply filters).
*   **`InventoryManagementPage.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `await waitFor` with `await screen.findByText` for initial data loading. Replaced `fireEvent` and direct `click()` with `userEvent` for all interactions (search, add/edit/adjust/history/delete item forms).
*   **`SeasonContext.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `element.click()` with `userEvent.click()`. Corrected the `allows selecting a different season` test to select a *different* season and assert the *newly selected* season.
*   **`AlertBanner.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `element.click()` with `userEvent.click()` for the close button interaction.
*   **`KPICard.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Corrected assertions for `shows negative trend indicator` in both `KPICard` and `CircularKPICard` to check for `changeText` and `trendingdownicon`.
*   **`PondCard.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `element.click()` with `userEvent.click()` for all card and button interactions.
*   **`QuickActions.test.js`**:
    *   **Fixes:** Replaced `element.click()` with `userEvent.click()` for all action card interactions.

##### **3.3. Address Runtime Errors (Revisited)**

The increase in runtime errors suggests deeper issues.

*   **Action:** Systematically review the test files associated with runtime errors. These often occur due to:
    *   **Uncaught Promises:** Asynchronous operations that are not properly awaited or handled, leading to unhandled promise rejections.
    *   **Missing Mocks:** Components or hooks trying to access unmocked dependencies (e.g., a service function that hasn't been mocked).
    *   **Incorrect Component Setup:** Components being rendered without necessary props or context, leading to crashes.

#### **4. Validation (No Change)**

The validation step remains the same: run the entire frontend test suite after applying fixes.

**Command:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Expected Outcome:** All tests should pass.
