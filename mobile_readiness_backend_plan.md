# Mobile-First Backend Development Plan

This document outlines the server-side development tasks required to support a high-performance, reliable, and offline-capable mobile-first frontend.

### Phase 1: API Performance & Payload Optimization

A fast frontend requires a fast backend. The goal of this phase is to minimize latency and data transfer.

1.  **Task: API Payload Analysis & Optimization**
    *   **Action:** Review the JSON responses for all primary `GET` endpoints (e.g., `/api/ponds`, `/api/feedInputs`, `/api/waterQualityInputs`).
    *   **Goal:** Identify and remove any fields or nested objects that are not essential for the client's primary views. For example, if a list view only shows a pond's name and status, the API shouldn't send the entire detailed pond object for every item in the list.

2.  **Task: Implement and Enforce Pagination**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all list-based endpoints (those that return an array of documents) properly implement pagination using query parameters (e.g., `?page=1&limit=25`).
    *   **Justification:** This is critical for performance and scalability, preventing the server from trying to send thousands of records in a single request, which is especially important for mobile clients.

3.  **Task: Database Query Optimization**
    *   **Action:** Analyze the queries generated by the Mongoose models, especially those with filters and sorts.
    *   **Goal:** Add compound indexes to MongoDB collections for fields that are frequently queried together (e.g., `seasonId` and `timestamp`). This will dramatically speed up data retrieval.

### Phase 2: Server-Side Caching Strategy

This phase focuses on reducing database load and improving response times for frequently accessed data.

1.  **Task: Integrate a Caching Layer**
    *   **Action:** Introduce a caching mechanism. For simplicity, an in-memory cache like `node-cache` can be used initially. For a more robust, scalable solution, `Redis` should be implemented.
    *   **Target Endpoints:** Good candidates for caching are endpoints that serve relatively static data, such as the list of all seasons (`/api/seasons`) or all ponds (`/api/ponds`).

2.  **Task: Implement Cache Invalidation**
    *   **Action:** Create a clear cache invalidation strategy. When data is updated, the corresponding cache must be cleared.
    *   **Example:** If a pond's details are updated via `PUT /api/ponds/:id`, the cache key for `/api/ponds` must be deleted to ensure fresh data is served on the next request.

### Phase 3: Offline Data Synchronization Support

This is the most critical backend phase for enabling a true offline PWA experience. It involves creating a system to accept and process data that was created by the client while it was offline.

1.  **Task: Data Model Timestamps**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all relevant Mongoose schemas have the `timestamps: true` option enabled. This automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, which are essential for sync logic and conflict resolution.

2.  **Task: Create Batch-Processing Endpoints**
    *   **Action:** For each data type that can be created offline (Feed, Water Quality, etc.), create a new endpoint that can accept an array of new records. For example: `POST /api/feedInputs/batch`.
    *   **Justification:** A single batch request is far more efficient than making dozens of individual API calls when the client comes back online.

3.  **Task: Implement Sync Logic and Conflict Resolution**
    *   **Action:** The controller for a `batch` endpoint must loop through the array of incoming records. For each record, it must perform validation.
    *   **Conflict Strategy:** Implement a "last write wins" strategy. If the client sends a record with a timestamp that is older than the `updatedAt` timestamp of the corresponding record on the server, the client's change can be rejected.
    *   **Response:** The API must return a detailed response to the client, indicating which records were successfully saved and which failed (along with a reason), allowing the frontend to handle the failed records appropriately.
